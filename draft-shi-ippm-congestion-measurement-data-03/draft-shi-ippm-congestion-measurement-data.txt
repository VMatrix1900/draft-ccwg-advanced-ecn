                 Data Fields for Congestion Measurement
           draft-shi-ippm-congestion-measurement-data-latest

Abstract

   Congestion Measurement collects the congestion information in the
   packet while the packet traverses a path.  The sender sets the
   congestion measurement command in the packet header indicating the
   network device along the path to update the congestion information
   field in the packet.  When the packet arrives at the receiver, the
   congestion information field will reflect the degree of congestion
   across network path.  Congestion Measurement can enable precise
   congestion control, aids in effective load balancing, and simplifies
   network debugging.  This document defines data fields for Congestion
   Measurement.  Congestion Measurement Data-Fields can be encapsulated
   into a variety of protocols, such as Network Service Header (NSH),
   Segment Routing, Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation
   (Geneve), or IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   To effectively manage network congestion, a detailed understanding of
   congestion levels across the network is imperative.  Congestion
   control algorithms, therefore, necessitate precise congestion
   measurements to adapt and optimize data flow.  This approach involves
   monitoring various metrics such as packet loss, delay variations, and
   throughput, which can provide a glimpse of the network's congestion
   state.  Enhanced congestion metrics allow for a more nuanced response
   to congestion, enabling algorithms to adjust sending rates with
   greater precision, thereby improving overall network performance and
   efficiency.

   Furthermore, the detailed congestion measurements obtained are not
   solely beneficial for congestion control; they serve multifaceted
   purposes, including load balancing and network operations debugging.
   By analyzing congestion data, network operators can identify and
   resolve bottlenecks, optimize traffic distribution, and ensure a
   balanced load across the network.  This data-driven approach
   facilitates proactive network management, allowing for timely
   interventions that can preempt potential disruptions and enhance
   network reliability and performance.

   Addressing the limitations of High Precision Congestion Control
   (HPCC)[I-D.draft-an-ccwg-hpcc], which leverages in-band telemetry for
   detailed congestion signal collection but faces challenges with
   packet size increases and computational redundancy, our proposed
   solution introduces data fields for Congestion Measurement.
   Congestion Measurement expands the conventional single-bit ECN to
   multiple bits, allowing network devices to update congestion
   information at each hop more granularly.  Consequently, when packets
   reach the receiver, the congestion information field in the packet
   accurately not just the presence of congestion but the degree of
   congestion across the link's path.  This nuanced approach facilitates
   a richer set of data for decision-making, supporting not only more
   precise congestion control but also improving load balancing and
   network debugging efforts.  By overcoming HPCC's shortcomings, our
   approach enhances network efficiency, reduces computational overhead
   at endpoints, and offers a scalable solution to managing congestion
   in complex network environments.  Congestion Measurement Data-Fields
   can be encapsulated into a variety of protocols, such as Network
   Service Header (NSH), Segment Routing, Generic Network Virtualization
   Encapsulation (Geneve), or IPv6.

2.  Overview

   Figure 1 shows the overview procedure of Congestion Measurement.
   First the sender MUST marks the packet with data fields for
   Congestion Measurement (see Section 3) which specifies what kind of
   the congestion information that the sending node intends to collect
   from transit nodes.  As the packet traverses through the network,
   each router should inspect the data fields and update the Congestion
   Info field accordingly.  Upon reaching the receiver, the updated
   congestion info data within the packet is extracted and then send
   back to the sender.  The sender, now equipped with the congestion
   information reflective of the packet's journey, uses this data to
   make informed adjustments to its sending rate or load balancing
   decisions.

4.  Example 1: HPCC with Congestion Measurement

   HPCC calculates the inflight ratio of each link(represent the link
   utilization of the link) from the collected raw load information
   carried in the INT.  Then maximum inflight ratio along the path is
   identified and used to adjust the sending rate.  The formula to
   calculate the inflight ratio of each link is shown below:

   txRate = (txBytes_1 - txBytes_2)/(t_1-t_2)
   inflight ratio = qlen/(B*T) + txRate/B

   where:

   *  txBytes: link total transmitted bytes associated with timestamp ts

   *  qlen: link queue length

   *  B: link bandwidth

   *  T: Baseline RTT

   Leveraging Congestion Measurement, the router participates in
   calculation of the maximum inflight ratio.  Each router MUST
   calculate the inflight ratio of the down link and then compare it to
   the one in the Congestion Info Data field and keep the larger one.
   When the packet arrives at the endpoint, the Congestion Info Data
   field already contains the maximum inflight ratio.  The sending rate
   adjustment algorithm remains unchanged.  By allowing routers to
   conduct these calculations, the computing overhead is reduced for the
   endpoint.  Since the update of value is in-place, the packet size
   remains unchanged regardless of the hops count.

5.  Example 2: Available bandwidth

   The ABW(available bandwidth) of links can be applied in existing CC
   algorithms to optimize their throughput performance, such as TCP Reno
   and CUBIC.  The sending rate and congestion window can be dynamically
   adjusted during the CC's slow-start and loss recovery phases.  The
   BBR algorithm, which detects link bottleneck bandwidth based on rate
   and round-trip time (RTT), can utilize the ABW to obtain the
   bottleneck bandwidth of the link and optimize data throughput
   efficiency.  Alternatively, a completely new CC algorithm can be
   designed based on ABW to predict and avoid congestion in advance.

   The method for obtaining the ABW of a link is shown as follows:

   1.  The sending node can obtain the ABW of its egress port, mark the
       packet with data fields for ABW Measurement, and then send the
       packet to the Receiving node.

   2.  Transit Node identify the ABW probe action based on the
       Congestion Measurement header, compare the ABW of their egress
       port with the ABW in the packet.  If the ABW of the current node
       is smaller than that in the packet, it updates to the link's ABW
       and forwards the packet; otherwise, it directly forwards the
       packet.

   3.  After receiving the ABW packet, the receiving node parses the
       link's ABW, constructs an ABW response packet, and sends it back
       to the sending node.

   The calculation of the current node's ABW can be referenced as
   follows: ~~~ ABW = B - T - R ~~~

   where B is the bandwidth of the egress port where the flow passes, T
   is the traffic size of that egress port, and R is the reserved
   bandwidth.  The reserved bandwidth takes into account the fairness of
   the CC algorithm, facilitating the entry of newly added flow.  The
   value of R can be set according to the specific circumstances of each
   node, allowing TOR switches and backbone routers to reserve different
   percentages of bandwidth.
